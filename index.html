                <td>Intro to HTML/CSS was the first module I completed. It was a great module to start off with since it taught some very basic coding through text. I learned how to make websites using HTML and CSS that can include lists, cool titles, different color fonts and backgrounds, tables and more. It was the only real module that I used to make this porfolio after all. This module mostly impacted me by teaching me some basic structure for coding. Without it, I would have definitely struggled more on the other modules. I will continue to learn as student by expanding my knowledge on HTML/CSS to hopefully make even better (more modern) looking websites.</td>

                <td>In my opinion, Intro to JS was the most impactful module that I completed. It gave me the basic framework of JS which I used for multiple modules later on. It taught me many basic things to do in JS like drawing and coloring rectangles and ellipses, making variables, as well as how to make and incorperate if statements, loops, arrays and much more. The part of the module that impacted me the most was learning how to make interactive programs such as the <b>"Make it Rain"</b> and <b>"Magic 8 Ball"</b> project. Making these kinds of programs is what gave me the fuel to continue pushing forward to this day.</td>

                <td>Advanced JS was basically the next step from Intro to JS in my opinion. I learned how to complete a bit more challenging things like how to make animated scenes that can change, how to translate and rotate shapes and images, and how to make some simle games. The parts of the module that I felt most engaged and impacted in were definitely the games I made. It really helped me put together everything I learned to create amazing projects like <b>"Hoppy Beaver Extreme"</b> and <b>"Memory++"</b>. I planned to bring the knowledge I've aquired so far in Advanced JS to help move forward into Natural Simulations since I knew that the module would be tough.</td>

                <td>Natural Simulations was definitely a very jam packed module that took the most time for me to complete out of all the modules I did; however I did learn many things during the process. Some of the most notable things I learned was how to make randomness through random gaussian in project <b>"Paint Splatter"</b> as well as perlin noise. However as the title of the module says; I was most intrigued by the segments where I learned how to make things interact with each other. This was shown in many projects so I won't bother listing them all, but the one that I was most proud of making was project <b>"Computational creatures"</b>. In this project I made a bug move around, but if it hit the venus fly trap then it would respawn elsewhere. I plan to continue learning and using this knowledge I've learned to continue as a student moving forward into university and during my own time. I plan to one one day make a game using JS with some friends during my spare time in the summer to make sure I don't forget what I learned in this module and the overall unit.</td>

                <td>This module is probably the one that I am least confident in since I had to rush this one thanks to the time constraint, however it still taught me a few things. It gave me a better understanding on the concept of pseudocode as well as giving me a good review of what I learned so far, like conditional statements, strings, and even some simple math. The most of an impact that this module made on me was a new way to learn programming through quizes. I will continue learning as a student by possibly reviewing certain aspects every so often somewhat like this module to make sure I do not forget anything that I consider important in computer science.</td>

                <td>In my opinion, this was by far the most interesting and well thought out module that I completed (with Amr). This was the only real module that I completed where I was not givin many instructions. We were assigned to make our own creative refactoring of Dan Shiftman's project <b><a href="https://editor.p5js.org/Vivethen/sketches/VQtMgwLtF">Snowfall (Snow Piles on Ground)</a></b>. Through watching the video of Dan Shiftman completing the project, I learned a lot about object oriented code and how it can effect the outcome of the simulation. The part that gave the biggest impact on me was trying to make snow pile up on the ground using my own knowledge for the first refactoring. For the second refactoring I made the snow fall much quicker by increasing the velocity limit for the snow. <b><a href="https://editor.p5js.org/Vivethen/sketches/NuEBQOFKo">Snowfall 2nd Refactor</a></b>  I also enjoyed doing the presentation portion, though it would have been more fun if I could see my participants in person. I plan to continue using what I learned in this module moving forward by trying to add more object oriented components to my code in my future projects in university. Here are the links to two of my peers projects that I engaged in. <b><a href="https://editor.p5js.org/Vivethen/sketches/8WXS-AaTv">Starfield</a></b> and <b><a href="https://editor.p5js.org/Vivethen/sketches/vOfXkQk-3">Acid Rain</a></b>.</td>

My topic was parents. The biggest thing that I took out of this assignment was how much of an impact the people around us make on what we do. In the cubing documentary, many people had their cubing career hurt or improved thanks to the influence of their parents. Moving forward, this assignment will help me remember that computer science is not a one person project. If I am ever feeling down, discouraged or frustrated about something, I always know that there are people around me that I can go to for help, support and encouragement.</td>

I have used it for other modules as well like the Creative Coding Session and Cubing Workflow. This module has made a big impact on me becuse it showed me all the different things that Github can do; like how to make a repository, how to make issues, solve them and merge conflicts, it also taught me how to use markdown as well as it had a lesson on HTML. I definitely plan to continue using Github for the rest of my computer science career to store code and work on pojects with others in a shared repo. It is easy to use and I love it for that reason!<br><br>Side note: I completed more github learning lab projects so please update my mark on the module! Thanks!

                <td>This module was for sure an interesting one. At first I saw no point in doing it, I was like "What does this have to do with computer science?" However as I proceeded to do the module I began to see some links between the two things. One of the major things I took out of it was how efficiency was key to improve your time. You can't stick to one method if you want to do well, but you need to be able to analyze the cube's state and find the best algorithm to solve the cube the fastest. This carries over to coding as well. When making a program it's best to make simple code that is clean and not repetitive to make it run faster and more efficiently. This can be done by making loops and functions to help minimize repetition in code. By doing this not only does the code run faster, but it takes less space, is easier to understand, and it's easier to change or update. This module has helped me understand this concept and I plan to use it moving forward to help make my code cleaner. Here's a link to the <b><a href="https://github.com/Vivethen/Cubing-Progress">github repo</a></b> for this module.</td>

Unfortunately I am still a rookie when it comes to this stuff so that's why I am not incorperating anything I learned there into this website. Some impactful things that I learned though are what DOM is (Document Object Model) and how to use it, a bit of how to make webpages interactive and how to add small animations as well. I plan to continue looking into DOM in the future to help my future webpages become more interactive and fun.<br><br>Side note: There were no "projects" in this module so I put images of some of the interesting challenges instead.
